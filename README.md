#### Problem Statement
To determine the percentage of each type of crime committed in the United States of America from 1960 through 2016.

#### Data Description

| Variable | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Year | The time frame span over 57 years, beginning from 1960 to 2016|
| Population | The population of each year has been assumed to be recorded at the end of the year |

| Burglary | The number of burglaries of each year have been recorded |
| Larceny | Theft The number of larceny thefts of each year have been recorded |
| Vehicle | Theft The number of vehicle thefts of each year have been recorded


#### Conclusion

The three highest number of crime types committed come out to be Property, Larceny
Theft and Burglary. All three are crimes that are perpetrated to gain from the victim, in
terms of value acquisition, rather than just causing physical harm. It can be deduced that
the primary reason for committing a crime is to accomplish an ulterior motive.
These are closely followed by Vehicle Theft, which is another example of delinquency for
personal gain.
